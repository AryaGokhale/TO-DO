# API Server in Golang
This is a REST API server implemented in Golang that provides various endpoints for user signup, login, and note management. It utilizes the Gin HTTP web framework and JWT tokens for session identification.

# Endpoints
The server implements the following endpoints:

Signup user: Allows users to create an account by providing their credentials.
Login user: Enables users to authenticate themselves and obtain a JWT token for subsequent requests.
Create notes: Allows authenticated users to create new notes.
Read notes: Retrieves existing notes for an authenticated user.
Delete notes: Enables users to delete their existing notes.

# Tech Stack
The API server is built using the following technologies:

Gin: A lightweight HTTP web framework for building RESTful APIs in Golang. It provides routing, middleware, and other essential functionalities.

JWT Token: JSON Web Tokens are used for creating unique tokens that identify each user session (sessionID). These tokens are used for authentication and authorization purposes.

Postman: REST API testing is performed using Postman, a popular API development and testing tool.

Swagger: Swagger will be used for further testing and documentation of the API. It provides a user-friendly interface to explore and interact with the API endpoints.

The docker-compose.yml file is provided to simplify the process of running the server in a container using Docker Compose. It defines a service called app, which is built from the Docker image specified in the Dockerfile. The service maps port 8080 of the container to port 8080 of the host machine.

After starting the server please access the API's via the localhost port 8080 
http://localhost:8080/signup : for signup
http://localhost:8080/login : for login 
http://localhost:8080/notes : for managing notes
